calcCohortProfile       Combines a given retirement distribution and
                        individual asset price (or efficiency) profile
                        to give the price (or efficiency) profile of a
                        cohort of assets. Depending on the given
                        combination method either the weighted average
                        method is used or the fixed profile method.
calcNetStock            Calculate the net stock by correcting the given
                        GFCF values for the combined age-price and
                        retirement distribution
calcProductiveStock     Calculate the productive stock by correcting
                        the given GFCF values for the combined
                        age-efficiency and retirement distribution.
                        This function is almost identical to
                        'CalcNetStock'. The duplication is deliberate
                        in case there might be Productive Stock
                        specific changes in the future.
calcSurvivalValues      Calculate the survival values for each vintage
                        given life length parameters and retirement
                        distribution
cohortProfileOne        Combines a given retirement distribution and
                        individual asset price (or efficiency) profile
                        to give the price (or efficiency) profile of a
                        cohort of assets. This version of the function
                        uses the weighted average method of combining
                        the two inputs.
cohortProfileTwo        Combines a given retirement distribution and
                        individual asset price (or efficiency) profile
                        to give the price (or efficiency) profile of a
                        cohort of assets. This version of the function
                        uses the fixed profile method of combining the
                        two inputs.
const                   Constant profile function: asset retains full
                        value (productive capacity) until the point
                        where it retires (given by T)
convertProfileToMatrix
                        Convert the given data.frame containing vectors

                        forwards by it's id
db                      Declining Balance profile function: similar to

                        represents the declining balance rate

                        and increasing with the number of periods
lin                     (Delayed) Linear profile function: value
                        (productive capacity) of asset declines
                        linearly after a given number of periods
